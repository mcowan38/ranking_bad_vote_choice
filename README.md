# Ranking Bad: The Chemistry of Ranked-Choice Voting
## Abstract
Crowder-Meyer et al. (2023) found that in U.S. ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections, Black, Asian, and Hispanic candidates consistently faced electoral disadvantages regardless of the informational context. Extending their approach to a Canadian setting, this study employs a conjoint experimental design to examine whether providing party labels can mitigate biases that hinder the electoral prospects of BIPOC candidates in a hypothetical Canadian RCV election scenario. Our findings indicate that, absent partisan cues, BIPOC candidates experience marked penalties, with voters across the political spectrum engaging in negative partisanship and affinity voting. Yet, when party affiliations are introduced, these disadvantages largely vanish. While our results are limited by a small, non-representative sample, they offer preliminary evidence that partisan cues may help counteract racial bias in Canadian RCV contexts. Together, these insights highlight the critical role of information availability and point toward future research on how electoral reforms and voter education might foster more equitable representation.
